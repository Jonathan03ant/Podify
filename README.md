# COMP2404 -Introduction of Software Engineering- Assignment 4
# In this assignment, I created a podcast network named Podify. This network is designed to hold Podcasts, each of which contains multiple Episodes. To enhance the user experience, I implemented a Search object. This object is capable of identifying Episodes that meet specific criteria and compiling them into a playlist.
# One of the key features of this project is the ability to play Episodes. Users have the option to experience the content with or without a video element, which is represented by unique ASCII art.
# The creation of Podcasts, Episodes, and Search objects is handled by a PodcastFactory.
